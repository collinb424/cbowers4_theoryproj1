## Note
- output_cbowers4.txt comes from running check_cbowers4.csv on the two_SAT_cbowers4.py file. Problem 1 corresponds to Problem 1000 on the CSV file, Problem 2 corresponds Problem 1001, and so on (I changed it to Problem 1, 2, etc to make it easier to read).
- Refer to readme_cbowers4.pdf for much more information on the project.
